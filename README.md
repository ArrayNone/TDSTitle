## what is this?
A vector font based on the logo font used in the game [TDS - Tower Defense Strategy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392280/TDS__Tower_Defense_Strategy/) by Blockage. 

asmanwoks (the lead developer of TDS) has provided a full sheet containing all of the current glyphs (only uppercase letters) to the community as a bitmap image. 
This project vectorises these uppercase letters, redesigning them when necessary, and adds new glyphs (symbols, numbers, lowercase letters, etc.) on top of it as an usable font file.

asmanwoks has granted permission to let me distribute this font on GitHub. (thanks!)

## download
> [!NOTE]
> Font coverage is limited. As of now, this font only covers the ASCII characters. Not even Extended ASCII.

Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/ArrayNone/TDS-BasicTimer/releases/) page to download the font.

This font has two variants:
- **Faithful:** A variant of the font that retains the original uppercase letters as it was on the provided sheet (specifically the letters V, X, Y, and Z), and
- **Rehydrated:** A variant of the font that redraws these said letters to be more distinct and legible.

## preview
![A preview of TDSTitle. The preview shows the Rehydrated variant at the top, Faithful at the middle, and any other glyphs that are shared between these two variants at the bottom as "Any Version". The Rehydrated and Faithful section shows the uppercase letters, while the Any Version section shows lowercase letters and symbols.](./preview1.png)

## special thanks
- **asmanwoks** for providing the original uppercase letters, granting permission for me to distribute this font on GitHub, and making Tower Defense Strategy in general
- **Reducki** for feedback, ideas, and especially for help assembling the version 1 of the font
