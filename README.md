## what is this?
A vector font based on the logo font used in the game [TDS - Tower Defense Strategy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392280/TDS__Tower_Defense_Strategy/) by Blockage. 

asmanwoks (the lead developer of TDS) has provided a full sheet containing all of the current glyphs (only uppercase letters) to the community as a bitmap image. 
This project vectorises these uppercase letters, redesigning them when necessary, and adds new glyphs (symbols, numbers, lowercase letters, etc.) on top of it as an usable font file.

asmanwoks has granted permission to let me distribute this font on GitHub. (thanks!)

## download
> [!NOTE]
> Font coverage is limited. As of now, this font only covers the ASCII characters. Not even Extended ASCII.

Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/ArrayNone/TDS-BasicTimer/releases/) page to download the font.

This font has two versions:
- **Faithful:** A version of the font that retains the original uppercase letters as it was on the provided sheet (specifically the letters V, X, Y, and Z), and
- **Rehydrated:** A version of the font that redraws these said letters to be more distinct and legible.

## special thanks
- **asmanwoks** for providing the original uppercase letters, granting permission for me to distribute this font on GitHub, and making Tower Defense Strategy in general
- **Reducki** for feedback, ideas, and especially for help assembling the version 1 of the font
